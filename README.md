# Airport setup project for EECS 293 Software Craftsmanship, Fall 2019
Creates an environment in which airports are set up, and flights created between airports. Passengers are placed on flights depending upon seat availability and factors such as flights' policies on altered seating. Routes are found for passengers traveling from point A to point B using an algorithm to find the most efficient path.
