Our program simulates flight data from airports. To test the file,
 first compile all of the classes then begin by running the test
  environment “AirportTest”. This will demo all methods to show 
  how the program will run. Note that to use junit testing two
  external jar files are needed: junit-4.13.jar and hamcrest-core-1.3.jar.
  Note that most compilers have these pre-installed.
